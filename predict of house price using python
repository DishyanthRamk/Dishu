# 1. Define the problem and gather the necessary data
data = pd.read_csv("house_prices.csv")

# 2. Clean and preprocess the data
data = data.dropna()

# 3. Split the data into training and testing sets
X = data[['size', 'location']]

# 4. Select and train a model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# 5. Evaluate the model
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print("Mean Squared Error: ", mse)

# 6. Deploy the model
# The model is now trained and can be used to make predictions on new data
